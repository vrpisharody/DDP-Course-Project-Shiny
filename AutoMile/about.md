Know Your Car's Fuel Efficiency:
=================

This application predicts a car's fuel efficiency based on the inputs provided by the user. It uses a truncated version of the **mtcars** dataset to run a regression analysis to predict an automobiles fuel efficiency. 

User interface is divided into three panes: 

1. Left of the screen houses the input pane for the user to provide inputs related to the car.
2. Middle or center of the screen houses the prediction pane which calculates and shows predictions.
3. Right of the screen houses the information pane, which provides a brief description of the application and method to use it.

All or any of the following inputs can be provided by the user to get a prediction of the automobile's fuel efficiency :

1. Number of Cylinders in car. This is a drop down list box.
2. Cylinder displacement of car. This is a slider input.
3. Transmission, Auto or Manual. This is a drop down list box.
4. Gross horse power. This is a slider input.

7. Number of carburettors. This ia a drop down list box.

Once the user is sure of the inputs, user clicks the **Predict** button at the bottom of the input pane. Based on the inputs, the application calculates the car's fuel efficiency and shows **mpg (miles per gallon)** and **kmpl (kilometers per litre)**.
